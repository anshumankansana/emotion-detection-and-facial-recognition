# 🤖 Emotion Detection and Facial Recognition Robot Girl Assistant

This project is a smart virtual assistant with emotional intelligence, facial recognition, and voice interaction. It reacts with sarcastic or caring personality traits based on the user’s emotion and identity, responding both visually and through voice.

> Built using Python, OpenCV, Dlib, FER, Text-to-Speech, and GPT-3.5 (optional).

---

## 🧠 Features

- 🔍 Real-time face detection and recognition
- 😊 Emotion detection using deep learning (FER)
- 💤 Tiredness detection via facial landmarks
- 🎤 Voice input (English + Hindi)
- 🔊 Voice replies using Text-to-Speech
- 🧬 GPT-3.5 personality engine (Optional: OpenAI or OpenRouter API)
- 🧠 Memory of known faces and their past emotions
- 💾 Persistent memory using `.pkl` files

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install these Python modules:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

> If `requirements.txt` is not provided, install manually:

```bash
pip install opencv-python dlib face_recognition numpy scipy pyttsx3 fer SpeechRecognition python-dotenv
```

---

## 🛠️ Setup

1. **Download Dlib's Landmark Model**
   Download from [dlib.net/files/shape\_predictor\_68\_face\_landmarks.dat.bz2](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2)
   Extract it into the same folder.

2. **Create a `.env` File (Optional if using GPT)**

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_or_openrouter_key
# Optional for OpenRouter
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
```

3. **Run the Assistant**

```bash
python face_emotion_memory.py
```

## 🧑‍💻 How it Works

* Detects face → Recognizes user → Detects emotion using FER
* Detects tiredness using Dlib facial landmarks (EAR/MAR)
* Talks back using a smart GPT-based personality
* Speaks responses aloud and listens to user's voice

---

## 🗣️ Supported Languages

* **Voice input**: Hindi (`hi-IN`) and English (`en-IN`)
* **Voice output**: Always replies in English

---

## ⚠️ Warnings & Tips

* If using GPT, make sure your API key is valid and not expired.
* File `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` is \~95MB — GitHub recommends using Git LFS.
* Use in well-lit environments for better face detection.

## 💡 Future Ideas

* Add animated 2D/3D avatar (Live2D or VTube Studio)
* Use voice cloning for more human-like responses
* Add chatbot memory for conversation history
